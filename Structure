Currently we have 3 folders, Back-End, Front-End, and Visual-Media.
The point is to use the 3-tier method, however the lowest layer won't be present seeing as we don't have a database (yet).
You could argue that the Visual-Media folder belongs in the Front-End folder. Fortunately this can changed, however the sooner the better.

The Back-End folder is for all JavaScripts
The Front-End folder is for all HTML scripts
The Visual-Media folder is for pictures and videos
